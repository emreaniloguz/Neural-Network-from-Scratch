# Neural-Network-from-Scratch


This repository is a code section from the tutorial that I have followed from Sentdex. The tutorial provides fundamentals of Deep Learning without any DL Library (Pytorch, Tensorflow, etc.). This course is a step for me to understand more complicated libraries such as Pytorch which I will be continuing with it.
